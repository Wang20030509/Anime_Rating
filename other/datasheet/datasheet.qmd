Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.

**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to enable analysis of anime and user preferences from MyAnimeList[@myanimelist]. Specifically, the gap addressed was the unavailability of "num_favorites" data through the API, which was manually collected to enhance the dataset.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - Doran Wang created the dataset.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The dataset creation was self-funded.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset combines automated API data and manually collected information to ensure completeness.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each instance represents an anime entry from MyAnimeList[@myanimelist], including details like title, genre, rating, and the manually added number of favorites.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- 50 obs (I set the limit, it can be more).
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a subset of all anime entries on MyAnimeList[@myanimelist], focusing on a curated selection relevant for analysis.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance includes features such as title, score, genre, and num_favorites (manually collected).
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No specific label or target was defined; the dataset is for exploratory analysis and modeling.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some attributes, like character details or specific user interactions, are not included because they are not available via the API.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No explicit relationships are included.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Splits can be created based on user-defined analysis needs, such as genre or rating distribution.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Manual entry of "num_favorites" may introduce small human errors despite best efforts for accuracy.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset relies on  MyAnimeList[@myanimelist] (MAL) as the source. Since MAL is a live platform, changes to its structure may affect reproducibility.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- The data was directly observable through the use of the MyAnimeList API[@malAPI]. Information about anime titles, ratings, popularity, number of users, and other metrics were directly extracted via automated requests to the API
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- Data was collected through the MyAnimeList API [@malAPI], which provides detailed information on anime, including ratings, popularity, and other related metadata. 
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- I sampled popular anime titles, I use a probabilistic sampling strategy based on user ratings or popularity
4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
	- Student: Doran Wang 
5. *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*
	- Data was collected over November 2024. The dataset reflects the current state of information as of the last API query on November 30, 2024.
6. *Were any ethical review processes conducted (for example, by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- The dataset was collected using publicly available API data from MyAnimeList[@myanimelist], which does not involve personal information or sensitive data. As such, no formal ethical review was required. However, the dataset complies with the terms of use provided by the MyAnimeList[@myanimelist] platform.
7. *Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (for example, websites)?*
	- The data was obtained from a third-party source, specifically the MyAnimeList API. The dataset does not involve collecting personal data from individuals directly.
8. *Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.*
	- As the data was collected from the MyAnimeList[@myanimelist] platform, which is publicly available and adheres to the site's terms and conditions, individual notifications were not required. The platformâ€™s terms of use govern the collection of data through the API.
9. *Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.*
	- The dataset does not involve direct data collection from individuals, as it relies on publicly available information from MyAnimeList[@myanimelist]'s platform. MyAnimeList[@myanimelist] users consented to the use of their data through their agreement to the platform's terms of service, which govern the use of publicly available data.
10. *If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).*
	- Since the dataset does not involve the direct collection of personal data from individuals, there was no mechanism for individuals to revoke their consent.
11. *Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (for example, a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- No data protection impact analysis was required, as the data does not involve personally identifiable information or sensitive data.
12. *Any other comments?*
	- The dataset complies with MyAnimeListâ€™s API terms of service, and no personal information is included in the dataset. It is intended for use in analysis of anime-related trends and statistics, without any personal data related to the users of MyAnimeList[@myanimelist].


**Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling**
